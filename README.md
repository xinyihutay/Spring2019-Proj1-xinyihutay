### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: Why are you happy? What makes your happy moments different from others?
+ This project is conducted by Xinyi Hu.

+ Project summary: Happiness is the emotion that we all share. However, things that make us happy might be relatively different from each other. Therefore, this project aims to analyze what makes people happy, and whether gender, marital status, parenthood and cultural background would differ the things and events that make people feel happy.
